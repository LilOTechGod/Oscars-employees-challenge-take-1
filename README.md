# Oscars-employees-challenge-take-1
### Challenge 10 for UT-Austin, TX Full stack web development bootcamp

## Description

This challenge is a collaberation of Node.js and object oriented programming. Working together I was able to test the back end without having the front end complete in order to check if my code will execute with a 200 ok satus code or return with an error, giving a 404 error status code. My goal was to generate an HTML page displaying cards for every single team member containing their portfolio. This challenge was in fact the most challenging. Being able to test and creating objects to reuse is good practice, in order to have a better understanding of object oriented programming I generated a HTML page through the terminal containing my team and I portfolios and knew it was going to work by testing each one out.
