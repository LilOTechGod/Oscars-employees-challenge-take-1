# Oscars-employees-challenge-take-1
### Challenge 12 for UT-Austin, TX Full stack web development bootcamp

## Description

This challenge is a collaberation of Node.js and object oriented programming. Working together I was able to test the back end without having the front end complete in order to check if my code will execute with a 200 ok satus code or return with an error, giving a 404 error status code.
